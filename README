cl-git

A git repository reader in Common Lisp

This started as at attempt to bind libgit2 from common lisp.  Although
it seemed to work for small repositories, trying to do anything with
the kernel git repo mostly just kept blowing my stack.

Being the disturbed person I am, I've started hacking together a
reader for git repositories directly in Common Lisp.

It's not even packaged yet.

Right now, all you can do is look up commits.  Most of the work was
unpacking packs.  It only supports v2 packs, and the ref delta isn't
supported, so it might just die.  But, I can read recent stuff out of
the kernel repo just fine.

  (defparameter *repo* (make-instance 'repo :path #p"/usr/src/linux/.git/"))
  (repo-lookup *repo* "refs/heads/master")
  (decode-commit *)
  (repo-lookup *repo* (first (commit-parents *)))
  (decode-commit *)

I have no idea what I will do with this.
